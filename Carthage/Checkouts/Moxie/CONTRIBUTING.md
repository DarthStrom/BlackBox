# How to contribute

Thanks in advance for your help!  Even just using Moxie in your project is a contribution in itself.

## Reporting an issue

* Check to make sure the issue has not already been reported by searching in the [Issues](https://github.com/DarthStrom/Moxie/issues)
* If you can't find an existing issue, you can [submit a new one](https://github.com/DarthStrom/Moxie/issues/new). Make sure to include steps to reproduce, what the actual behavior was and what you expected it to be.  If possible, also include an executable test case.

## Fixing an issue

* Open a GitHub pull request with the fix. The description should clearly describe the problem and the solution.
* Include the relevant issue number if there is one.

## Suggesting a feature or change

* First, open an issue describing your suggestion and how it is beneficial.
* If you intend to implement the feature, declare it in the discussion for the issue so that the effort is not duplicated. Then, wait to implement until there has been a discussion about the improvement and it is accepted.

Thanks again!
